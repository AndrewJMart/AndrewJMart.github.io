Here you will find blogs and posts from the perspective of a junior dev. While most of my wisdom is likely questionable and ill advised, I hope my struggles, learning, and growth can provide clarity to those who read.  

The posts you will find will range from projects I create, opinion blogs, and even self reflection. Take what you find with a grain of salt and hint of humor.  

If you wish to reach out to me, please do so via email (amart89531@gmail.com) or via LinkedIn (see bottom of page). I am happy to help out anyone in anyway I can!
