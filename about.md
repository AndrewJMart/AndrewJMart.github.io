# About Me

<div align="center">

I am a recent grad of Cal Poly with a double major in Business Admin & Stats w minors in DS & CS. I am currently plugging away at ML problems involving satellites within Boeing's Defense department down in LA. Outside of my job, I am an avid fan of the Raiders, Kings, A's, and Bama. I made this blog to document my progression as a SWE/MLE and hopefully inspire others to pursue growing their knowledge, even if they are from nontraditional backgrounds.
