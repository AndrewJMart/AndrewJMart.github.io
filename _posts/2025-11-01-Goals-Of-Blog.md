excerpt: Insights On Why I Decided To Create This Blog.
---

Welcome to my first post! I recently decided to create this blog for a variety of reasons.  
To ensure that I hold myself accountable, I wrote this first post to outline what my goals are for this space.

## Relight the Fire

My first computer science experience was a summer camp I attended at Sac State, where we learned the basics of C++ and Unreal Engine to create games.  

During that camp, I built a text adventure game alongside a zombie shooter. I remember having an absolute blast and will never forget the excitement I felt watching those projects come to life.  

However, when it came time to see other students' presentations, a creeping feeling entered my mind. Little did I know, it was my first experience with *imposter syndrome*.  

Throughout my journey in computer science, that feeling has reappeared many times. To combat it, I plan on enjoying the *process* of learning and creating by documenting my progress through this blog.  

Rather than worrying about the “quality” of the projects I create, I want to build, engineer, and learn for the love of the field, not just to stack my résumé.

### Takeaway
While I stoke my own fire, so should you! Life is too short to compare yourself to other people. Don't let comparison be the thief of your joy. Enjoy your own journey.

## Honesty

Anyone who has met me in person will agree that I'm often very blunt.  
So, in true *Andrew fashion*, I intend to keep this blog straightforward and genuine.  

I believe there's a lot of *fluff*, *misinformation*, and *mumbo jumbo* online that discourages or even gatekeeps people from pursuing their goals in computer science.  

Every post here, whether I'm exploring general CS concepts or sharing personal projects, will carry a sense of pragmatism and honesty.  

This bluntness isn't meant to be harsh; it's meant to provide you, the reader, with a raw look at the journey of a fellow computer scientist.

### Takeaway
While bluntness isn't a superpower, it can help cut through the BS. Finding the right sources to trust is important in any aspect of life, including computer science.  

Also, the posts I create may, and likely will, have conceptual and or literal errors in them. Learn to have a healthy dose of skepticism and let that guide your curiosity.

## Guidance

Though my career in CS is still in its infancy, I wouldn't be here without the support of my friends, mentors, and partner.  

I hope these posts can offer inspiration, guidance, and nuggets of knowledge that you can take with you on your own journey.  

This blog isn't meant to be a complete guide to computer science, no single resource ever could be, but I hope some of my experiences help you along the way.  

### Takeaway
Seek help! Don't be cavalier or shy, use the resources around you as you mosey your way down the river. I hope that I can provide anyone who reads this with nuggets of knowledge, and perhaps even a good laugh.

As a special shoutout, the abstract name of the blog "The Shade" is a special nod to a special person in my life who inspires me to healthily better myself everyday.
